# Project Nova V9
### A Script hub exclusively for The Strongest Battlegrounds!

- #### I named this hub "Project Nova" bc I got inspired by a Project JoJo script called "Nova Hub" which I liked.
  
<h4 style="color: red;">Be aware this script could get you banned!</h4>

## Project Nova's Loadstring:
```lua
getgenv().ToggleUI = "J"-- //  Key Toggle "J" set by default however you can change it.
getgenv().ProjectNova = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lvl9999/TheStrongestBattlegrounds/main/ProjectNovaV9";

pcall(function()
    loadstring(game:HttpGet(getgenv().ProjectNova))();
end)
```
- #### I also made a script for Sakura Stand. I recommend you to check it out! [Here](https://github.com/Lvl9999/SakuraStand)
